            My odyssey and association with Delhi Public School Society started when I joined Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, in 1969 under the stalwart, legendary Principal ‚Äì Late Sri Din Dayal who conceptualized the very idea of establishing this school, wherein, I worked for 5 years. It was in February 1974, that I became a part of the world acclaimed Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, the school that stands for excellence and has given this country many distinguished personalities like doctors, engineers and leaders in various fields and spheres under the exemplary vision and dynamic leadership of the then Principal, Sh. R.S. Lugani. I joined the institution in the capacity of Deputy Head, promoted to Head of the Department and finally elevated to the position of Vice Principal. Giving new dimensions to education through my selfless, innovative and disciplined pursuit of excellence, I was the first teacher from NCR region to be selected and decorated for the National Award in 1988. Because of my wide experience, dedication and commitment in the field of education, in the year 1995, I was given the responsibility to establish a new educational venture in the industrial city of Faridabad. It was a real challenge that I accepted and took over, without any infrastructure.
